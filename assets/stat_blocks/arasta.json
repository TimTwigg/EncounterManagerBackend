There, within Enorasi's hollow trunk, Arasta awaits the next would-be prophet to make her meal. Her webs stretch beyond the branches of the tree and carpet the forest floor of her realm. \n\nTales are told of forlorn souls who, because of grief or madness over the loss of a loved one, have sought out Arasta's lair, as it is rumored that some of the strands of her web are anchored near the edge of the Underworld and can enable a traveler to reach that realm's ashen shores.
